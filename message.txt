Hi there!

I'm Jeremy, the dev working on the Cult MTL website redesign. I've copied Lorraine on this email to assure you I'm not a spam-bot or anything.

I'd love some help getting your author information updated, when you have a moment could you provide me with:

- A professional~ish profile photo
- A short bio (40-50 words about 250 chars. Please don't include any links)
- (optional) Any social links you would like to showcase (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, whatever)
- (optional) A public facing email for readers to use to get in touch

All this info can be changed later so it's not essential for it to be perfect right away (I'd appreciate speed more than perfection).

If you have any questions feel free to reach out. I'm easiest to access on the Cult MTL slack channel @ https://cultmontreal.slack.com (you should sign up if you haven't yet) but you can also call or email.

Thanks!
Jeremy
